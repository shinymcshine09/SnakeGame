# SnakeGame

This is a remake of Nokia's Snake game in Java as my first personal project. The purpose of this project was to give me something relatively easy to code.

## Description

Although this is a remake it is not attempting to clone the original game it just uses the general rules and gameplay, implemented in Java with homemade sprites.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* JavaSE-11 (this is what i used when writing the project, although earlier/later versions will most likely run the programme too)

### Installing

* Download the repository from GitHub and open with Java or what ever coding software you are using (I use VS Code). Make sure all .java files are in the same folder when attempting to run.

### Executing program

* To run the programme open SnakeGame.java and run the file or the below function in the same file directly.
```
public static void main(String[] args)
```
